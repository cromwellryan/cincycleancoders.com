<p><h2>Purpose:</h2>Cincy Clean Coders provides an environment to teach, learn, and experiment with software development patterns, practices, and techniques for creating high quality software which changes at the pace of our customers.

<p><h2>When:</h2>1st Thursday of each month from 6pm to 8pm.  (Next: April 7th, 2011)</p>

<p><h2>Where:</h2>Max Train in Mason, Ohio - <a href="http://www.maxtrain.com/directions/" target="_new">Directions</a></p>

<p><h2>Format:</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>Define and Describe</i> the pattern, practice, or technique</li>
<li><i>Demonstrate</i> the pattern, practice, or techique.  At least 2 languages or platforms.  (i.e. C# and Javascript)  This should be kept very simple.  Don't drown out the topic out with periphery code.</li>
<li><i>Discuss</i> when this does or doesn't apply, how it can be combined with other patterns, practices, or techniques.  This is also an opportunity to discuss how this pattern, practice, or technique helps.</li>
<br/><br/><br/>
<div class="note"><i>Note:</i> After speaking with <a href="http://twitter.com/ardalis">Steve Smith</a> of the <a href="http://hudsonsc.com">Hudson Software Craftsmanship</a> group we might be better off having only one topic with more hands on activities.  We can discuss this at the first Cincy Clean Coders on April 7th, 2011</div>
